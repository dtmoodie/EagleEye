Eagle eye is a prototyping software for computer vision algorithms.


This software was created with a few main goals in mind.

1) Create an easy to use GUI that makes development, fast, easy and flexible

2) Save processing algorithm configurations into a portable container to allow for fast assembly of algorithm components.

3) Create a library that can easily be linked into other programs including command line programs

4) Primarily GPU accelerated processing

5) 2d and 3d vision capabilities

6) Rapid prototyping capabilities via runtime modifiable code and an easy to use plugin interface.


External Dependencies:
OpenCV 3.0 commit > 237f33d4f032b0496cb3bedd7a86bfed8468a739 (This adds a cv::Mat::setDefaultAllocator interface for using my custom allocators.  Which is easy to remove if necessary)
Boost
Qt 5.5 (Older versions will probably work, current opengl code is based on the new shared context introduced in 5.5)
CUDA

Some plugins depend on other external dependencies, but they are not necessary.

This project depends on various other submodules which can be loaded by:
git submodule update --init --recursive
